# chef


Meta buildtool for Yocto Project based Linux embedded systems

The aim of this project is to prepare the needed directories and configuration files before running a Yocto Project build.

The tool is called `chef` to follow the culinary metaphore specific to the Yocto Project.

`chef` uses a configuration file called a _menu_ :-) which describes which sources (git repositories for example) have to be downloaded and which commits have to be extracted.
It also describes the specific lines to be written into the `local.conf` file and which layers have to be selected.

`chef` can also call directly `bitbake` to run the build.


## Maintainers

- [Christophe Blaess](https://github.com/cpb-/)
- [Patrick Boettcher](https://github.com/pboettch)

## `chef` command line arguments

The `chef` command accepts some arguments to know what to do. The first argument is the sub-command name (`cook`, `prepare`, `build`...) sometimes followed by options, menu filename or targets names.

The top-level sub-command proposed by `chef` is:

- `chef cook {menu file} [targets...]`: does the whole production job from the initial configuration up to the final image(s). 

In fact, `chef cook` is equivalent to the two medium-level commands:

- `chef prepare {menu file}` downloads the needed layers, and fills the configuration files into the build sub-directory.

- `chef build [--sdk] [targets...]` runs `bitbake` to produce the given targets. If no target are indicated on the command line, `chef` builds all the targets of the menu file. With the `--sdk` option on the command line, `chef` will also build the cross-compiler toolchain and headers.

Some finer-grained sub-commands are also available:

- `chef init {menu file}`: store the current menu filename into the `.chefconfig` configuration file. The content of the configuration will be explained later.

- `chef update`: pull the version of each layer indicated in the current menu file.

- `chef generate`: prepare the configuration files (`local.conf`, `bblayers.conf`, `template.conf`) needed by Yocto Project.

In fact `chef prepare menu-file` is equivalent to `chef init menu-file; chef update; chef generate`.

Each time you do some changes in the menu file, you may need to call:

- `chef update`: if you have modified a commit number or you want to pull the latest version of a branch
- `chef generate`: if you have modified a `local.conf` attribute

Then `chef build` to restart the compilations.

## How to build a standard image for Raspberry Pi 3?

First, install the `chef` script into a directory included in your `PATH` environment variable:

```
$ git  clone  https://github.com/cpb-/chef
$ cd  chef/
$ pip3  install  -r requirements.txt
$ ln  -sf  $(realpath  chef)  ~/bin
$ PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```

Then enter a work directory where the build will take place:

```
$ mkdir  ~/build-dir
$ cd  ~/build-dir
```

You can call `chef` with a single command to build the whole content of a menu file:

```
$ chef  cook  ~/chef/pi3-sample-menu.json
```

Or you can proceed in two steps:

First, ask `chef` to `prepare` the needed files and directories to build the `pi3-sample-menu.json` menu file:

```
$ chef  prepare  ~/chef/pi3-sample-menu.json
```

After a few minutes, the work directory will contain the needed layers and the configuration files.

```
$ ls
build-pi3  meta-openembedded  meta-raspberrypi  poky
```

Then you can run a full build with:

```
$ chef  build
```

You will see the classic Yocto Project progress messages, and after a while the build will complete with:

```

## Directory map

`chef` downloads the needed sources in the current working directory and create a build sub-directory.
For example, after running `chef prepare {menu file}`, the working directory could contains:

```
./---+--- poky/
     +--- meta-openembedded/
     +--- meta-raspberrypi/
     +--- meta-sunxi/
     +--- meta-custom-layer/
     +--- build-bananapi/
     +--- build-pi3/
     +--- build-pi4/
```


## Menu content

The menu file follows the JSON syntax and contains three main parts:

- `sources`: which describes how to download the correct versions of the layers,
- `layers`: (optional) the list of the layers used by every targets,
- `targets`: a collection of targets to build.


### Sources

The `sources` section is an array of methods to get the layers.
Each object of the array describes one layer.

The following attributes can be used:

- `url`: the URL used to download the layer. If missing, `chef` will consider that the layer is already present and will not try to download anything.
- `dir`: the path of the layer relative to the directory where you run `chef`. If `url` is present, this is the place to store the downloaded layer. If `url` is absent the layer must already be there and in that case `dir` is mandatory.
- `method`: the way to handle the versionning of the layer. `chef`is currently developped mainly for `git`. Other methods will be available in the future.
- `branch`: the `git` branch to use. Especially usefull when no `commit` is given.
- `commit`: the `git` index of the revision desired.

`chef` aims to build reproducible systems.
Using a specific `commit` number for each layer is the best way to do this.

If only a `branch` attribute is given, `chef` will try to pull the last remote update if an `url` is present.
But this is not as reproducible as giving a fixed `commit` number.


### Common layers

This section contains an array of layers common to all targets.

Most of the targets uses

- `poky/meta`
- `poky/meta-poky`
- `poky/meta-yocto-bsp`
- `meta-openembedded/meta-oe`


### Targets

The `targets` section is a collection of target objects to build.
The name of the target is used to create the build directory.

For example, when preparing the compilation of the `pi3` target, `chef` creates the `build-pi3` directory.

The target object contains two attributes : the specific layers and the specific configuration.


#### Target specific layers

The `layers` attribute is an array of layer names which can been downloaded from the `sources` section.

We recommand to indicate in this section the layers used only for this target and to keep the more general ones in the `layers` section seen above.


#### Target specific configuration

The `local.conf` attribute is an array of lines to add into the target configuration file.

`chef` produces a standard `local.conf` file and add the given lines.

Basically, each target will contain at least a `MACHINE` specification with the form:

```
  "MACHINE = 'raspberrypi3' "
```

You can use simple quotes to surround variable value.

### Comments

You can add a `notes` section (array of free strings ignored by chef) to insert your own comments into the menu as the same level as `sources` or `target` or into the `target` section.
